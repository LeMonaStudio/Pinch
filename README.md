# Pinch

The Pinch and Zoom app is part of a codelab in the Swift UI Masterclass on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/swiftui-masterclass-course-ios-development-with-swift/).
This app demostrates the possibilities with animation and gestures using Swift UI. 

## What I learnt
As I continue to learn more using Swift UI, with this codelab I was able to learn new cool stuffs with Swift & Swift UI such as
1. Swift UI Animation
2. Gestures (Drag gestures, OnTap gestures, Magnification gesture, OnLongPress gestures)
3. Code structuring 
4. Data Modeling 
5. Passing actions down the view hierarchy using closures.

## What the App does
The app displays an image which can be zoomed in either by using controls at the bottom of the screen or pinching and dragging away on the
image. When zoomed, there is a Text UI that shows the X and Y coordinates of the dragging and the level of magnification. This UI can be 
enabled by long pressing on the custom circle view at the top-leading corner of the screen.

By tap the chevron image button, a new view can be seen displaying thumbnails of the two images available for display within the app. When
each image is clicked the app updates the UI with the original image.
